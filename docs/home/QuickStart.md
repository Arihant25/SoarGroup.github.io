<!-- TODO: face palm emoji: ðŸ¤¦ please just restructure the release to simplify this for everyone -->

Pre-requisite: if you would like to use the graphical applications included with Soar, such as the debugger and VisualSoar, you will need [Java version 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?variant=openjdk11) or higher installed.

1. Download Soar Release archive [here](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/releases/download/releases%2F{{soar_version}}/Soar-Release-{{soar_version}}.zip) and extract to the location of your choice.

2. Inside the extracted directory, you'll find SoarSuite/SoarSuite_{{soar_version}}-Multiplatform.zip. Extract it in place.

3. Run the Soar debugger via the script included in this folder (SoarJavaDebugger.sh for Linux/Mac, SoarJavaDebugger.bat for Windows).

The other included applications are used in the tutorial, which is included under `Documentation/`. The manuals for Soar and VisualSoar can be found there, as well. 

You can also build Soar from [source](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar) if you'd like to work with the latest version or make changes to it.

Once you have Soar running, you can follow the [Soar Tutorial](../tutorials/soar_tutorial/index.md) to learn how to use it.
<!-- TODO: once the tutorials are online, link to them here. -->
