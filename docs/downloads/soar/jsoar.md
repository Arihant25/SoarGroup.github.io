# JSoar

JSoar is a pure Java implementation of most of Soar. Periodic development efforts
bring it up-to-date with the most recent version of Soar.

While there may be a reduced feature set,there are a few benefits to a pure-Java
implementation of Soar:

*   Idiomatic Java API in contrast to CSoar's SWIG-generated bindings.
*   "Free" multi-language support (JRuby, Jython, Rhino (JavaScript), Groovy, 
Scala, Clojure, etc)
*   A codebase and tools more friendly to rapid research prototyping
*   No native libraries to deal with
*   Cleaner integration with "enterprisey" systems
