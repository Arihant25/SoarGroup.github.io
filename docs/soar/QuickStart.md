<!-- TODO: face palm emoji: ðŸ¤¦ please just restructure the release to simplify this for everyone -->

Pre-requisite: if you would like to use the graphical applications included with Soar, such as the debugger and VisualSoar, you will need [Java version 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?variant=openjdk11) or higher installed.

1. Download the Soar distribution [here](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar/releases/tag/releases/9.6.2) and extract to the location of your choice.

2. Extract SoarSuite/SoarSuite_9.X.X-Multiplatform.zip in place.

3. Run the Soar debugger via the script included in this folder (SoarJavaDebugger.sh for Linux/Mac, SoarJavaDebugger.bat for Windows).

The other included applications are used in the tutorial, which is included under `Documentation/`. The manuals for Soar and VisualSoar can be found there, as well. 

You can also build Soar from [source](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar) if you'd like to work with the latest version or make changes to it.

<!-- TODO: once the tutorials are online, link to them here. -->
